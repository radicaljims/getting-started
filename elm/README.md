# Getting Started in Elm

- Read this page and install Elm for your platform: https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html
- Don't forget to setup your editor of choice!
- And pay attention to the part about `elm-reactor`

# The Elm Architecture

- https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/
- This will refresh your memory about the MVC-style architecture Elm favors

# elm-mdl

- https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/
- The UI framework used here; lots of nice examples at the page above

# The Source

- Is all in src/! Probably a Main, a Model, and a View! Maybe a Types and Util as well!

# Running Stuff

- After installing Elm, try running `elm-make` in this directory
- If everything goes well, run `elm-reactor` in this directory and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

# Suggestions For Improvements

- There are a few TODO's in the code, like for removing friends; those are good places to start
- Maybe a way to add friends?
- Badges for when friends do a good deed?
- Make things prettier?
